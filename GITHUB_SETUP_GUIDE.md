## 🔑 Authentication Required

You need to authenticate with GitHub to push. Choose one of these methods:

### Option 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not installed
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login
```

### Option 2: Personal Access Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate a new token with `repo` permissions
3. Use it when prompted for password

### Option 3: SSH Key (Most Secure)
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add to SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key and add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Onyx2406/ILF-PROJECT.git
```

## 📋 Push All Branches & Create PRs

After authentication, run this script:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /home/yash/Downloads/ILF-PROJECT-main

# Push main branch first
git push -u origin main

# Push all feature branches
git push -u origin feature/core-utilities-tests
git push -u origin feature/authentication-tests
git push -u origin feature/currency-tests
git push -u origin feature/database-tests
git push -u origin feature/security-compliance-tests
git push -u origin feature/error-handling-tests
git push -u origin feature/api-tests
git push -u origin feature/test-infrastructure
```
